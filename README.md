# Getting Started with Create React App

`useReducer` ==> is a React Hook that lets you add a reducer to your component.

const[state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg)

`useContext` ==> is a React Hook that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component.

# Passing data deeply into the tree

# Updating data passed via context

# Specifying a fallback default value

# Optimizing re-renders when passing objects and functions
